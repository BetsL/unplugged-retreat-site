# unplugged-retreat-site
Outdoor retreat site for mobile + tablet + desktop. Photoshop design comp utilized. Nature prioritized.

My favorite part of this project was learning about adding the responsive iframe. I'm now curious about how the backend of forms work and am interested in knowing more as I'm creating a site for my school's recycling club that will involve receiving/processing user info. Though I am pleased with the overall quality of the project, there seem to occasionally be loading issues with regard to the initial background photo that I'd like to explore.
